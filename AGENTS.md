# AGENTS.md — wtfoc

Instructions for AI agents working on this codebase.

**Read these first, in order:**
1. [`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md) — foundational rules (invariants that apply to everything)
2. [`.specify/memory/constitution.md`](.specify/memory/constitution.md) — governance and development discipline
3. Feature specs in `.specify/specs/` — what you're actually building

## Project Overview

**wtfoc** ("What The FOC") is a decentralized knowledge tracing and recall tool built on FOC (Filecoin Onchain Cloud). It ingests knowledge from multiple sources (Slack, GitHub, docs, code), extracts relationship edges, stores everything on verifiable decentralized storage, and traces evidence-backed connections across sources.

## How to Work on This Project (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every change follows the spec-kit flow. No exceptions.

1. **`/speckit.specify`** — create the specification
2. **`/speckit.clarify`** — clarify and de-risk ambiguities (run before /plan)
3. **`/peer-review`** — spec reviewed by a different agent (Cursor or Codex). Address all feedback before ratifying.
4. **`/speckit.plan`** — create implementation plan from ratified spec
5. **`/speckit.checklist`** — generate quality checklists to validate spec (optional)
6. **`/speckit.tasks`** — generate actionable tasks from plan
7. **`/speckit.analyze`** — validate alignment & surface inconsistencies (optional, before /implement)
8. **`/speckit.implement`** — execute implementation
9. **`/speckit.taskstoissues`** — convert tasks to GitHub issues (optional)

Other commands: `/speckit.constitution` — update project principles

Do not skip steps. Do not "write the spec later." The spec is the shared source of truth.

## Core Architecture Invariants

These are restated from SPEC.md so you don't have to dig through external docs.

1. **Every seam is an interface** in `@wtfoc/common`. Six seams: Embedder, VectorIndex, StorageBackend, SourceAdapter, ManifestStore, EdgeExtractor.
2. **Storage results are backend-neutral.** `StorageResult.id` is always present. `ipfsCid` and `pieceCid` are optional.
3. **Manifests and segments have `schemaVersion`.** Readers reject unknown versions. Writers always use latest.
4. **Single writer per project.** Concurrent updates rejected via `prevHeadId` mismatch.
5. **Ingest order:** chunks → embed → extract edges → bundle segment → upload → verify → update head → update local pointer.
6. **Trace ≠ search.** Trace follows explicit edges. Search finds semantically similar chunks. Trace falls back to search when no edges exist.
7. **`@wtfoc/common` is contracts only.** No I/O, no SDK wrappers, no business logic.

## Developer Workflow

### Bootstrap
```bash
pnpm install                          # install all deps
pnpm -r build                        # build all packages (common first)
pnpm --filter @wtfoc/store build     # build one package
```

### Test
```bash
pnpm test                            # run all tests from root (vitest)
pnpm test -- --watch                 # watch mode
```

### Lint & Format
```bash
pnpm biome check .                   # lint + format check
pnpm biome check . --fix             # auto-fix
```

### Build Order
`common` → `store` → `ingest` / `search` (parallel) → `cli`

TypeScript project references handle this automatically.

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode
- Biome for formatting and linting
- **No `any`** — use `unknown` and narrow
- **No `as unknown as`** — if you need a double cast, the types are wrong. Fix the types.
- **No non-null assertions (`!`)** — check existence, throw descriptive error if missing
- **Named errors only** — use typed error classes from `@wtfoc/common` with stable `code` fields. Never `throw new Error("broke")`.
- **No default exports** — named exports only
- **ESM only** — `"type": "module"` in all packages
- Long-running operations accept `AbortSignal` for cancellation

## Commit Style

- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`
- Scope with package name: `feat(store): add FOC upload support`
- Keep commits atomic — one logical change per commit
- Link issues: `Fixes #n` or `Refs #n`
- Each commit must produce a working state

## Definition of Done (for PRs)

- [ ] Spec exists and is ratified (cross-reviewed)
- [ ] Tests pass (`pnpm test`)
- [ ] Tests test behavior, not implementation
- [ ] Biome passes (`pnpm biome check .`)
- [ ] Package builds (`pnpm -r build`)
- [ ] Public API changes: update SPEC.md
- [ ] No secrets, PII, or real customer data
- [ ] README updated if user-visible behavior changes

## Error Handling

- Typed error classes from `@wtfoc/common` with stable `code` field
- Error codes: `MANIFEST_CONFLICT`, `STORAGE_UNREACHABLE`, `EMBED_FAILED`, `SCHEMA_UNKNOWN`, etc.
- CLI exit codes: 0 success, 1 general, 2 usage, 3 storage, 4 conflict
- Never throw raw strings — always use error classes

## Adding Dependencies

Before adding a dependency, check:
- [ ] Bundle size impact
- [ ] License compatibility (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD — no GPL)
- [ ] Actively maintained?
- [ ] Native addons? (bad for portability)
- [ ] Belongs in `common` (only if pure schema/type helper) or leaf package?

## What NOT to Do

- Don't skip the spec-kit flow
- Don't add features not in a ratified spec
- Don't put I/O or business logic in `@wtfoc/common`
- Don't add GraphRAG, RAPTOR, ColBERT — future work
- Don't build a web dashboard — CLI only for MVP
- Don't over-abstract — three similar lines beats a premature abstraction
- Don't scaffold `@wtfoc/memory` or `@wtfoc/mcp` until core is stable

## Key Dependencies

```
@filoz/synapse-sdk       — FOC storage (upload/download/datasets)
filecoin-pin             — IPFS↔Filecoin bridge (CAR creation, dual CIDs)
@huggingface/transformers — local embeddings (MiniLM-L6-v2)
viem                     — wallet/chain interaction
commander                — CLI
```

## Parallel Agent Work

Multiple agents (Claude, Cursor, Codex) work in parallel on this project. **Read the full coordination protocol in [`.specify/memory/constitution.md`](.specify/memory/constitution.md) under "Parallel Agent Coordination".**

Key rules:
- **One agent per issue** — check labels before starting (`assigned-claude`, `assigned-cursor`, `assigned-codex`)
- **Only pick up `ready` issues** — unlabeled or `blocked` are off-limits
- **Each issue gets its own branch + worktree** — no shared working directories
- **PRs for all changes** — no direct commits to main
- **Respect dependencies** — if issue says "Depends on #X", wait until #X is merged
